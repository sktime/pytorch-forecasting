    "This notebook is just an example to demonstrate D1 compatibility with the `TimeXer` model. Considering that there is no concrete design for a TSLib specific D2 layer, for the time being we are using the `EncoderDecoderDataModule` and `BaseModel` for implementing `TimeXer`. The implementation is rather confusing with many overlapping bits because the D2 isn't solely built for TSLib, but is a demonstration of how `TimeXer` works with the latest version of v2 rework and shows promise for more models from TSlib."
